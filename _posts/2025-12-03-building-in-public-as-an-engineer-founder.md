I build products. Occasionally, something is worth documenting.

This site is a log, not a feed. I write here after something has been built, tested, or learned, not while it’s hypothetical. I spend enough time in my head already.

## How this log works

- I write to clarify my own thinking.
- Posts are infrequent by design.
- Entries document real work, not plans or opinions.
- This is documentation, not commentary.

Most ideas don’t need to be published. The ones that survive building usually do.

That’s it. Shipped.
